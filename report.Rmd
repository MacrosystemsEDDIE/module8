# **Macrosystems EDDIE Module 8: Using Ecological Forecasts to Guide Decision Making**

# Learning Objectives:

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Describe what ecological forecasts are and how they are used (Activity A)
- Identify the components of a structured decision (Activity A, B, C)
- Examine how an ecological forecast may affect decision-making (Activity B)
- Understand how stakeholder needs affect forecasting decision support (Activity B, C)
- Discuss how forecast uncertainty changes over time and how forecast uncertainty can be visualized for decision-makers (Activity A, B, C)
- Create visualizations tailored to specific stakeholders (Activity C)

# Why macrosystems ecology and forecasting?

Why macrosystems ecology?

**Macrosystems ecology** is the study of ecological dynamics at multiple interacting spatial and temporal scales (e.g., Heffernan et al. 2014). Macrosystems ecology recently emerged as a new sub-discipline of ecology to study ecosystems and ecological communities around the globe that are changing at an unprecedented rate because of human activities (IPCC 2013). The responses of ecosystems and communities are complex, non-linear, and driven by feedbacks across local, regional, and global scales (Heffernan et al. 2014). These characteristics necessitate novel approaches for making predictions about how systems may change to improve both our understanding of ecological phenomena as well as inform resource management.

**Forecasting** is a tool that can be used for understanding changes in macrosystems ecology. To anticipate and prepare for increased variability in populations, communities, and ecosystems, there is a pressing need to know the future state of ecological systems across space and time (Dietze et al., 2018). Ecological forecasting is an emerging approach which provides an estimate of the future state of an ecological system with uncertainty, allowing society to prepare for fluctuations in important ecosystem services. Ecological forecasts are a powerful test of the scientific method because ecologists make hypotheses of how ecological systems work; embed their hypotheses in models; use the model to make a forecast of future conditions; and then when observations are available, see how their forecast performed, which indicates if their hypotheses are supported. Consequently, macrosystems ecologists are increasingly using ecological forecasts to predict how ecosystems are changing over space and time. However, forecasts must be effectively designed and communicated to those who need them to make decisions in order to realize their potential for protecting natural resources.

The theme of this module is understanding how **forecasts are connected to decision-making of stakeholders,** or those who use forecasts to aid in decision-making**.**Ecological forecasts have vast potential for aiding decision-making for range of different stakeholders, yet forecast results may be challenging to understand because they inherently are associated with uncertainty in alternate future outcomes which have not yet occurred. This module will teach students the basic components of an ecological forecast; the importance of connecting forecast visualizations to stakeholder needs for aiding decision-making; and to create their own visualizations of probabilistic forecasts of ecological variables for a specific stakeholder.

# Today&#39;s focal question:

## _How can ecological forecasts and their visualizations aid in decision making?_

To address this question, we will examine existing ecological forecasts to explore how decisions are made and how visualizations can be tailored to different stakeholders. We will be identifying the diversity of ecological variables currently being forecasted, as well as the different types of stakeholders and needs for making decisions with current ecological forecasts. We will also use output from a real water quality forecasting system to examine how uncertainty in forecast output changes over time, and how this can impact decision-making into the future. Lastly, we will explore how different ways of visualizing forecast output can be useful for different types of stakeholders of the forecast.

**As you go through the module, you will answer the questions below and turn in your answers at the end of the activity for credit.**

# Name:

# Pre-Module Questions: Think about it!

Before starting Module 8, think through your experience using forecasts to make decisions and answer the following questions:

1. Name of a forecast that you have encountered.
2. How you do use this forecast to make decisions?
3. When are you more and less confident in using the forecast to make a decision?
4. What other groups of people do you think could use this forecast?
5. How do you access the forecast?
6. How does the forecast represent the likelihood that the outcome will occur?
7. Would you be more confident in using the forecast to make a decision if you saw more or less information about the uncertainty?

Use these questions to get students to develop a hypothesis that they will test in the activities

**Objective 4a: Decide how to manage a drinking water reservoir using an ecological forecast**

You now have access to the 14-day water quality forecast leading up to the day of the swimming event, June 6. Every day as time gets closer to the swimming competition, the forecast will update with new data, allowing you to update your decision. On each of the designated days, you must make a decision about whether to A) Continue with the swimming event as planned, B) Cancel the event, or C) Treat the reservoir with an algaecide. submit your answers below. Remember that the forecast includes 25 different ensemble members, which are different forecast estimates, and what you are seeing here is the mean of those ensembles.

As you make your decisions, remember that water becomes dangerous for drinking when the chlorophyll-a concentration goes above 25 ug/L and dangerous for swimming when the chlorophyll-a concentration goes above 35 ug/L.

Days before the event: 14\
What is the mean forecasted concentration for June 6 in the 14-day forecast?\
**Answer:** `r params$aobj4a_day14_mean`\

In your own words, describe the forecast over the next 14 days leading up to June 6.\
**Answer:** `r params$aobj4a_describe`\
