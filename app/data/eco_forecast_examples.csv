Naturecast Phenology Forecasts,https://phenology.naturecast.org/,"This project produces spatial forecasts of phenological events such as bud burst (when flowers first bloom each year) or leaf out (when leaves first appear) for a variety of plant species around the US, produced by ecologists at the University of Florida. The forecast presented here shows predictions for the date of leaf out across the U.S. for the maidenhair tree (Gingko biloba).",Phenology_forecast_gingko.png,"Hint: Try the different options for Issue Date, Species, and Phenophase to select a forecast that interests you.",85%,85%
Phenology Monitoring at the Morton Arboretum,https://www.rolliecology.com/phenology,"This project forecasts the probability of bud burst (when flowers first bloom each year) of various types of tree species at the Morton Arboretum in Illinois, USA using forecasted weather data. The forecast presented here is for bud burst of Quercus marcocarpa, or bur oak, at the Morton Arboretum.",Morton_forecast_cropped.png,,85%,100%
Portal Forecast,https://portal.naturecast.org/,"This project forecasts desert rodent abundances using a long-term historical dataset. The forecast presented here shows total rodent abundance, which includes species like the northern pygmy mouse (Baiomys taylor), tawny-bellied cotton rat (Sigmodon fulviventer), and the silly pocket mouse (Perognathus flavus), among many others.",portal_rodent_forecast.png,Hint: Look at all the different forecast visualizations on the 'Current Forecast' tab before choosing one for Objectives 1 and 2.,120%,140%
EcoCast,https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/ecocast/,EcoCast is a fisheries sustainability tool developed by NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) that helps fishers and managers evaluate how to allocate fishing effort to optimize the sustainable harvest of target fish while minimizing bycatch of protected or threatened animals. The forecast presented here shows  areas which are predicted to be more or less suitable for minimizing fisheries bycatch and maximizing catch of desired fish species.,EcoCast_forecast.png,Hint: Look at both the EcoCast Map and the EcoCast Explorer to customize your forecast visualization and explore different scenarios based on decision-needs,100%,50%
Smart & Connected Water Systems,https://smartreservoir.org/forecasts/,"This project develops forecasts of water temperature every meter from the surface to the bottom of Falling Creek Reservoir in Virginia. The forecasts are made using high-frequency sensors, weather forecasts, and ecosystem models. The project aims to improve the management of drinking water supply lakes and reservoirs.",SCC_watertemp_forecast_Sep.png,Hint: Watch one of the videos under 'In the News' tab to learn more about why this project is making waves in ecological forecast and water management,95%,85%
GrassCast,https://grasscast.unl.edu/,Grass-Cast is an experimental grassland producitivity forecast for the Great Plains region which uses a nearly 40-year historical dataset combined with seasonal precipitation forecasts to predict how rangeland productivity will different from past trends. The forecast presented here shows the predicted percent change in Annual Net Primary Productivity (ANPP) compared to the historical ANPP across the Great Plains region of the U.S.,GrassCast_forecast.png,Hint: Watch the Grass-Cast video under the 'Introductory Video' tab to learn more about the motivations and process behind the Grass-Cast forecasts.,100%,55%
Coral Reef Watch,https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/satellite/bleachingoutlook_cfs/outlook_cfs.php,The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Coral Reef Watch uses remote sensing and models to produce forecasts of coral reef environments worldwide.
